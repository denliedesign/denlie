				You come to this planet. You see a black and dusty ground; a red sky with some dark clouds; on the ground, fire spits out of the ground, like mini volcanoes, but no mountain. Its hot there, but you feel a cold chill in your body.This planet was found by a man named Ryushi, therefore he is incharge, or the king.

					September 11, 2000 - ITS BACK!!!!!!!!!! I thought for a moment and felt i should bring it back up, BUT, in order to make your member "active" you must create a page of you're own where you do all the updating to your character, the "nonactive" characters are the ones that are in the members section, but they will be not updated by me, since i spend all of my computer time doing the members updates. Also, it takes alot of time to update all the pages for some simple side bars, adding new things n such, so im just posting the NEW links on the main page. So the site is back, but now there is lil pesky rules n stuff, big deal! at least its back!
