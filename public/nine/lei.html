				<h2>Leighanief Der Sukato</h2>
				<p>
1. Name: Leighanief Der Sukato
<br>2. Age: 17 - 19 (depends on timeline... she's 19 one year before Majin buu shows up)
<br>3. Race: Pure-breed Saiya-jin
<br>4. Alignment(good or evil): Chaotic good (she follows her own rules)She can loose control sometimes when going Super Saiya-jin and has a bloodlust(instincts heightened)... but still is not evil.
<br>5. Siblings: All dead except any she doesn't know of. An except Kakarott, he's her uncle but he doesn't know of her and she's never told anyone.
<br>6. Marital Status: Single
<br>7. Children: None
<br>8. Moves(newbies can only chose 5): Senkosayha (a blast similar to Kamehameha), Synthisato (a countering attack, it inflicts no damage but can match strong attacks), Gisam√© Donash (a freezing attack, it can be deadly), ordinary ki balls and blasts, a healing move *doesn't have a name yet*(can use it on others not herself)
<br>9. Transformations: none yet
<br>10. level (will start out as 50,000 or less): 50,000
<br>11. Extra: Leigh's quite beautiful except for a large scar that crosses down her eye, and part of her cheek, her eyes ebony and her shoulder-length hair a deep and very dark brown, and a strange raven black wrapping around her upper right arm, and her tail is clearly Saiya-jin but it is different from that of a normal saiya-jin, it is a dirty blondish colour containing streaks of a gleaming sort of blue. Under her black wrapping is a four sided (diamond-shaped) jewel that is the colour of tinted blue glass. She never lets anyone touch it or usually even see it, so if you get lucky enough I'll give you a better description. (same as her amulet, i'll give you better desc. if ever seen...) She's had a very hard past that she rarely speaks of and can get very agressive about it sometimes...
<br>12. AIM Screen Name(s):Panthera tigrisa
