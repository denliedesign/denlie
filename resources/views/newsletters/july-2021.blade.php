                                July has been a month of adventure, choreography, and a little bit of rest.

                                <br><br>The month started with a nice family vacation and moved into 2 weeks of choreography for our Fall ballet. Now as July comes to an end it feels like school is right around the corner.  Thank goodness we still have August to prepare :)

                                <br><br>I hope that you all have had some time to get away and have some family and some rest time.

                                <br><br>Dancers like my little one are ready to get into class. What can we do with our websites to get ready for the next season? Follow the checklist below.

                    Lets focus on website images.  Photos invite people into your studio before they walk in and give them the best glimpse of your space, programs, and culture.
                    <br><br>
                    Have someone who is experienced with taking pictures (even if itâ€™s a social media savvy senior with an iphone) to drop in a variety of classes and take pictures. What a great leadership opportunity for them as well! Got a staff meeting coming up? Gather everyone together for a 2021-2022 photo-shoot.
                    <br><br>
                    This month I challenge you to go through and update your photos.
