                                We are calming down from the busy season, getting in a good groove with our dance classes, and settling into the cool calm of Fall. We’ve already started visiting orchards and enjoying pumpkin spice and apple-cinnamon flavored goodies.

                                We also started our 2 year old in gymnastics this month and the process reminded me how important it is for people to have clear direction and quick answers to find something that fits their needs.  Check out this month’s feature that will help your clients know exactly what they are signing up for and feel comfortable and confident walking in :)

                                    Remember your website is a portal into your dance studio, so keep it up to date with everything that is going on. Update calendars, events, promos, newsletters, photos and more.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Optimizing your website is a process that continues through every season, even when things are calming down. A great website has great communication which in turn builds a great community.

                                    Sincerely,
